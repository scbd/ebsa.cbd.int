Projections of changing ice conditions due to climate change indicate that the central Arctic Ocean beyond national jurisdiction and in adjacent Canadian waters is likely to retain ice longer than all other regions of the Arctic, thus providing refugia for globally unique ice-dependent species, including vulnerable species, as the ice loss continues. A shift towards less multi-year sea ice will affect the species composition and production of the primary producers in the area, with potential cascading effects throughout the ecosystem. In a situation with decreasing ice cover, the effects on the ice fauna will be strongest at the edges of the multi-year sea ice. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are highly dependent on the sea ice habitat and are therefore particularly vulnerable to changes in sea ice extent, duration and thickness. The multi-year ice habitat is especially important as breeding habitat for polar bears of the southern and northern Beaufort Sea subpopulations.

The coastal waters of the Kola Peninsula are used by beluga whales (Delphinapterus beluga) as a migration corridor and feeding area. Other cetaceans listed on the IUCN Red List are also regularly observed here, such as humpback whales (Megaptera novangliae), sei whales (Balaenoptera borealis) and white-beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris)."},"region":{"identifier":"B23DF27C-4E0C-481F-90DE-0120B095AB29","title":{"en":"Arctic"}},"url":"http://chm.cbd.int/database/record?documentID=204090"},"style":{"strokeColor":"#FFFFFF","fillColor":"#FFFFFF"}},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[40.166244221814566,68.77182813493535],[40.358469882938664,68.69587979875922],[40.361327527467836,68.69443493537108],[40.662359980598126,68.6272411297729],[41.2037073139569,68.4520414659652],[41.55012957553054,68.25027805034745],[41.84327624963032,68.13460003877107],[42.146353647077376,68.05900007398292],[42.25778056839994,67.96307679516494],[42.34507420931607,67.85140754930937],[42.465907267306534,67.71829022480124],[42.54115535588011,67.57677187576066],[42.80772398011021,67.19691141540697],[41.364071624391556,67.19259767095852],[41.34443620614314,67.21581814641868],[41.318327206118795,67.22831814643037],[41.265963206070126,67.21762714642038],[41.245273206050854,67.21249114641556],[41.133045205946416,67.23206314643376],[41.11069120592555,67.25095414645138],[41.14110920595374,67.35081814654441],[41.150273205962435,67.41692714660599],[41.058600205876985,67.46581814665151],[41.03582720585564,67.4677541466533],[41.03416320585427,67.58942714676668],[41.05193620587079,67.61401814678949],[41.049718205868714,67.65859114683107],[40.99221820581511,67.71609114688464],[40.9391542057657,67.73331814690069],[40.909991205738606,67.73511814690231],[40.80401820563986,67.72498214689293],[40.69665420553986,67.77026314693508],[40.484300205342144,67.74888214691508],[40.463609205322825,67.75499114692086],[40.3994362052631,67.79220914695551],[40.33047320519887,67.84679114700629],[40.39012720525437,67.84943614700882],[40.41200020527481,67.86504514702335],[40.362073205228285,67.8999911470559],[40.14471820502598,67.9506821471031],[40.0130542049032,68.01277314716097],[39.89554520479379,68.12081814726159],[39.809991204714144,68.15277314729136],[39.75249120466054,68.16887314730636],[39.7211002046314,68.15599114729436],[39.7913822046969,68.12220914726288],[39.85262720475379,68.04407314719015],[39.74138220465028,68.04664514719249],[39.57110920449162,68.061100147206],[39.262218204203975,68.1660911473038],[39.109436204061694,68.21138214734594],[38.93054520389501,68.30359114743186],[38.629718203614914,68.38261814750547],[38.603882203590786,68.38750014751001],[38.50790920350153,68.36601814748998],[38.5222182035148,68.35138214747633],[38.60860020359519,68.32748214745408],[38.54610020353715,68.32527314745208],[38.4327732034315,68.33915414746497],[38.39596320339711,68.38727314750979],[38.3273542033333,68.43886314755785],[38.04735420307253,68.53692714764891],[37.8247182028652,68.65832714776207],[37.7733272028172,68.67609114777856],[37.6463822026991,68.71277314781275],[37.49500020255806,68.73526314783368],[36.9913822020892,68.8972181479846],[36.60082720172534,69.0133181480927],[36.26471820141233,69.07443614814959],[35.97499120114253,69.17303614824144],[35.45857320066165,69.2533271483162],[35.29518220050937,69.26890914833078],[35.178191200400306,69.27365414833517],[35.157973200381605,69.26385414832603],[35.26078220047725,69.21786314828323],[35.185127200406896,69.18071814824859],[35.147682200371946,69.18828214825562],[35.13622720036136,69.21363614827925],[35.10761820033474,69.21975414828495],[34.792773200041495,69.23470914829889],[34.64747319990619,69.25092714831393],[34.443045199715755,69.28137314834231],[34.41730019969168,69.304591148364],[34.361654199639986,69.31707314837557],[33.87110019918305,69.3327631483902],[33.719154199041554,69.33137314838892],[33.60943619893936,69.31971814837809],[33.57805419891025,69.30844514836755],[33.560409198893524,69.27956314834064],[33.56777319890051,69.18385414825154],[33.440545198782104,69.10304514817625],[33.075273198441835,69.05941814813568],[33.07362613000714,69.05820838986219],[33.04332719841232,69.07040914814584],[33.07638219844296,69.08082714815559],[33.314154198664255,69.11581814818817],[33.51665419885313,69.18136314824918],[33.53818219887307,69.20419114827045],[33.47443619881375,69.27499114833638],[33.409436198753156,69.28457314834529],[33.37915419872496,69.28471814834546],[33.267863198621285,69.26596314832798],[33.24151819859668,69.26909114833094],[33.298327198649645,69.29706314835695],[33.3608271987079,69.29970914835943],[33.471327198810734,69.35043614840667],[33.51617319885253,69.42248214847375],[33.45750019879796,69.4441361484939],[33.32694519867624,69.44886314849829],[33.165827198526245,69.41914514847063],[32.972663198346424,69.3879001484415],[32.901100198279664,69.31040014836937],[32.80604519819127,69.30277314836226],[32.834518198217836,69.33041814838799],[32.832836198216114,69.34579114840237],[33.008491198379716,69.43578214848614],[33.02941819839924,69.47186314851973],[32.66832719806297,69.49970914854569],[32.487773197894796,69.48970014853636],[32.268054197690105,69.42442714847556],[32.22249119764763,69.42414514847532],[32.201763197628395,69.4285091484794],[32.269163197691164,69.4387271484889],[32.49455419790104,69.50540914855102],[32.

Sea"},"description":{"ar":"The White Sea, the youngest sea in Europe, has a peculiar oceanographic regime with cold, deep water formation in the Gorlo strait. The Gorlo area is characterized by strong tidal currents creating high turbulence and mixing the water column down to the seabed (Timonov, 1925; Naumov and Fedyakov 1991; Pantyulin 2003; Kosobokova et al., 2004). It spreads cold water to the south and fills the deep areas \nof the entire White Sea and retains sub-zero temperatures all year round (Timonov, 1950; Pantyulin, 2003; Kosobokova et al., 2004). These specific conditions form a biotic boundary that limits dispersal of fauna from outside the area into the White Sea (Derjugin, 1928; Naumov, 2006; Solyanko et al., 2011). \n\nDeep areas filled with cold water provide habitats for pelagic and benthic biota, while upper layers and shallow areas host typical boreal fauna and macrophyte flora (i.e., kelp and seagrass) (Derjugin, 1928; Berger and Naumov, 2001; Naumov, 2001). In certain areas, the number of macrobenthic species exceeds 460 (Spiridonov et al., 2012), while number of phytoplankton species in the White Sea exceeds 440 (Ilyash et al., 2013). The White Sea harbours two endemic subspecies of fish, migration routes of Atlantic salmon and their abundant stocks (Studenov, 1991, 2011). \n\nBays and islands of the White sea provide breeding habitats for 17 species of aquatic birds (Semashko et al., 2012) and serve as nesting areas of common eiders (Somateria molissima). This area overlaps with the East Atlantic flyway and thus has huge importance as a migration corridor and staging area (Lehikoinen et al., 2006). The polynyas that develop in winter are important wintering grounds for several seabird species (Krasnov et al., 2010, 2011). With regards to marine mammals, the White Sea contains important feeding, whelping and moulting areas of harp seals (Pagophilus groenladicus) (Melentyev and Chernook, 2009; Svetochev and Svetocheva, 2011) and extremely important mating grounds of beluga whales (Delphinapterus beluga) (Svetochev and Sveticheva, 2011).","en":"The White Sea, the youngest sea in Europe, has a peculiar oceanographic regime with cold, deep water formation in the Gorlo strait. The Gorlo area is characterized by strong tidal currents creating high turbulence and mixing the water column down to the seabed (Timonov, 1925; Naumov and Fedyakov 1991; Pantyulin 2003; Kosobokova et al., 2004). It spreads cold water to the south and fills the deep areas \nof the entire White Sea and retains sub-zero temperatures all year round (Timonov, 1950; Pantyulin, 2003; Kosobokova et al., 2004). These specific conditions form a biotic boundary that limits dispersal of fauna from outside the area into the White Sea (Derjugin, 1928; Naumov, 2006; Solyanko et al., 2011). \n\nDeep areas filled with cold water provide habitats for pelagic and benthic biota, while upper layers and shallow areas host typical boreal fauna and macrophyte flora (i.e., kelp and seagrass) (Derjugin, 1928; Berger and Naumov, 2001; Naumov, 2001). In certain areas, the number of macrobenthic species exceeds 460 (Spiridonov et al., 2012), while number of phytoplankton species in the White Sea exceeds 440 (Ilyash et al., 2013).

on benthic production. It differs from the rest of the Barents Sea by its more continental climate, lower salinity, shallow depths and lowland shores. The most outstanding environmental feature is the Pechora River — the second-largest river draining into the European part of the Arctic Ocean. Its discharge influences this area and justifies certain biological features. The Pechora Sea is known to hold rich and highly productive benthic communities supported by considerable nutrient influx transported by the Pechora River. The benthic fauna numbers more than 600 taxa. Total biomass recorded at the Kolguev shallow, in the Kara and Yugor Shar straits, exceeds 500 mg/m2, which is the highest value found in the Barents Sea. This provides a good food base for benthic-feeding animals like sea ducks and walruses. Waterbirds represent another remarkable biological feature of the area. The Pechora Sea is located in the centre of the East Atlantic flyway and is a key stopover site for the majority of waterfowl species during the final stages of their migrations. Most of the waterfowl and other aquatic birds do not pass the area in transit but make extensive use of the rich food resources of sea shoals and sheltered bays, the littoral zone and adjacent coasts. Altogether, about 130 bird species are observed there. The Pechora Sea serves as a key habitat for Atlantic walrus and provides an important feeding ground and migration path for beluga whales (IUCN VU). Polar bears inhabit the area throughout the year. In addition to this, the Pechora Sea basin supports the only European stock of Arctic cisco (Coregonus autumnalis) and is an important migration area for the Pechora Atlantic salmon stock. It also serves as a principal spawning area for the polar cod.","en":"The shallow, south-east portion of the Barents Sea, known as the Pechora Sea, has specific oceanography,hydrology, ice regime and a distinct ecosystem mainly based on benthic production.

The most outstanding environmental feature is the Pechora River — the second-largest river draining into the European part of the Arctic Ocean. Its discharge influences this area and justifies certain biological features. The Pechora Sea is known to hold rich and highly productive benthic communities supported by considerable nutrient influx transported by the Pechora River. The benthic fauna numbers more than 600 taxa. Total biomass recorded at the Kolguev shallow, in the Kara and Yugor Shar straits, exceeds 500 mg/m2, which is the highest value found in the Barents Sea. This provides a good food base for benthic-feeding animals like sea ducks and walruses. Waterbirds represent another remarkable biological feature of the area. The Pechora Sea is located in the centre of the East Atlantic flyway and is a key stopover site for the majority of waterfowl species during the final stages of their migrations. Most of the waterfowl and other aquatic birds do not pass the area in transit but make extensive use of the rich food resources of sea shoals and sheltered bays, the littoral zone and adjacent coasts. Altogether, about 130 bird species are observed there. The Pechora Sea serves as a key habitat for Atlantic walrus and provides an important feeding ground and migration path for beluga whales (IUCN VU). Polar bears inhabit the area throughout the year. In addition to this, the Pechora Sea basin supports the only European stock of Arctic cisco (Coregonus autumnalis) and is an important migration area for the Pechora Atlantic salmon stock. It also serves as a principal spawning area for the polar cod.","zh":"The shallow, south-east portion of the Barents Sea, known as the Pechora Sea, has specific oceanography,hydrology, ice regime and a distinct ecosystem mainly based on benthic production.

ice zone. Atlantic and Arctic water masses meet here and form the polar front, which is characterized by strong gradients in both temperature and salinity, and its position fluctuates along the eastern Barents Sea, thus accounting for the\nenhanced productivity of the entire coast off western Novaya Zemlya. Another feature supporting high productivity is a marginal ice zone, which moves in the course of a season in the same area. The area provides feeding grounds for common species of Barents Sea pinnipeds and ceatceans as well as breeding grounds for bearded (Erignathus barbatus) and ringed (Phoca hispida) seals. The system of shore leads and drift ice up along the west coast of Novaya Zemlya is supposed to constitute a spring migration route for beluga of the Kara stock and possibly for Atlantic walrus.\n\nThe high productivity of this marine area supports the largest seabird colonies in the North-East Atlantic, including a large breeding population of common eiders. Rare and threatened species/habitats include staging and moulting grounds for the threatened Steller's eider and longtailed duck (Speers and Laughlin, 2010). Benthic biomass in some places exceeds 1000 g/m2 at the western shore, and the area thus serves as an important feeding ground for Atlantic walruses. In winter the marginal ice zone, polynyas and leads off the west coast of Novaya Zemlya are important wintering areas for seabirds (Krasnov et al., 2011) and polar bears.","en":"The coast of western and northern Novaya Zemlya in the Barents Sea is a highly productive marine area based on a fluctuating polar front zone and marginal ice zone.

The system of shore leads and drift ice up along the west coast of Novaya Zemlya is supposed to constitute a spring migration route for beluga of the Kara stock and possibly for Atlantic walrus.\n\nThe high productivity of this marine area supports the largest seabird colonies in the North-East Atlantic, including a large breeding population of common eiders. Rare and threatened species/habitats include staging and moulting grounds for the threatened Steller's eider and longtailed duck (Speers and Laughlin, 2010). Benthic biomass in some places exceeds 1000 g/m2 at the western shore, and the area thus serves as an important feeding ground for Atlantic walruses. In winter the marginal ice zone, polynyas and leads off the west coast of Novaya Zemlya are important wintering areas for seabirds (Krasnov et al., 2011) and polar bears.","zh":"The coast of western and northern Novaya Zemlya in the Barents Sea is a highly productive marine area based on a fluctuating polar front zone and marginal ice zone. Atlantic and Arctic water masses meet here and form the polar front, which is characterized by strong gradients in both temperature and salinity, and its position fluctuates along the eastern Barents Sea, thus accounting for the\nenhanced productivity of the entire coast off western Novaya Zemlya.

Mouth","ru":"Ob-Enisei River Mouth","zh":"Ob-Enisei River Mouth"},"description":{"ar":"The Ob and Enisei gulfs form the largest estuarine area in the Arctic. The continental outflow here is the greatest recorded in the Arctic seas. A large amount of fresh, warm river discharge causes an unstable saline regime in the upper layer of the largest part of the Kara Sea. Primary production in the frontal areas is high, which supports large stocks of freshwater and semi-anadromous fishes, aquatic birds and waterfowl. Anadromous and semi-anadromous species perform seasonal migrations through the estuary, while fast ice in the outer part of the river mouth zone serves as an important spawning area for the polar cod. The coastal zone of the area is characterized by exceptionally high biological and landscape diversity (coastal systems of transient habitats from sandy beaches to tundra, or “laidas”). It is the area where most of the biological hotspots are observed. \n\nThe area supports a variety of aquatic bird species. Most of them have closer relations to the marine habitats during non-breeding seasons. These include globally threatened species like Steller’s eider (Polysticta stelleri), velvet scoter (Melanitta fusca) and long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis), which breed in tundra but make extensive use of coastal waters during the non-breeding period.

The continental outflow here is the greatest recorded in the Arctic seas.

Anadromous and semi-anadromous species perform seasonal migrations through the estuary, while fast ice in the outer part of the river mouth zone serves as an important spawning area for the polar cod.

Unlike most shelves in the Russian Arctic seas, it is not influenced by the discharge of great Eurasian rivers. Most of the area is filled by water originating from the Bering Sea, which enters through the Bering Strait in seasonal pulses and circulates in the Chukchi Sea (Zalogin and Kosarev, 1999). There is a large, stable gyre in the eastern part of this area (known as the Ratmanov Gyre), which stabilizes the conditions, provides a significant supply of nutrients and high primary production that fluxes to the bottom, and is the basis for stable and persistent benthic communities (Sirenko et al., 2009a). The biomass of benthic infauna and epifauna is very high (Speer and Laughlin, 2011: A). Around Wrangel Island, landfast ice and polynyas are formed. The formation of polynyas off Wrangel Island is a result of the interaction between the Arctic and the Siberian anticyclones. The area is largely untouched by human activities. \n\nThis area provides a spring migratory pathway for hundreds of bowhead whales daily, as well as beluga whales, polar bears, Pacific walrus and gray whales during summer and autumn (Speer and Laughlin, 2011: A). There are no proven endemic species in the area, however, several species have been described in the Chukchi Sea that are thus far known only in this region (Sirenko, 2009). In winter, the polynyas adjacent to Wrangel Island form an area with a high concentration of ringed (Phoca hispida) and bearded (Erignathus barbatus) seals and their predators — polar bears (Ursus maritimus) (Belikov et al., 1998). The area serves as a feeding area for seabirds, walruses and cetaceans.","en":"The Wrangel – Gerald Shallows and Ratmanov Gyre is a shelf area in the Russian part of the Chukchi Sea.

cetaceans."},"region":{"identifier":"B23DF27C-4E0C-481F-90DE-0120B095AB29","title":{"en":"Arctic"}},"url":"http://chm.cbd.int/database/record?documentID=204098"},"style":{"strokeColor":"#FFFFFF","fillColor":"#FFFFFF"}},"geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[180,70.1489625744714],[179.31766877935956,70.19013245806896],[179.3084199831885,70.19094271521732],[178.64734000954948,70.26758170007173],[178.63850988887359,70.26886737439318],[178.01506380264584,70.37927375800962],[178.00684559325765,70.3810074211445],[177.42759879999446,70.52495245701658],[177.42019413389184,70.52710181495192],[177.15476223040153,70.62734391289693],[177.15065173564662,70.6293747075343],[176.90386447421585,70.78285402897224],[176.90105355048834,70.78513096812934],[176.75944860504,70.94056270566354],[176.75798780741513,70.94298071727708],[176.72241192586912,71.02099335279954],[176.72165253084654,71.02344721326325],[176.70875475968714,71.10470569970248],[176.70873481330216,71.10717234660713],[176.72115419538054,71.19089658407174],[176.7219058150171,71.19335033383851],[176.76214789345434,71.27859751641479],[176.76369543342932,71.28101020323423],[176.82938464975433,71.36198191943281],[176.831699249284,71.36432774637335],[176.9262908003007,71.44483270984594],[176.92937767376822,71.44708248192823],[177.191998038489,71.59382129444087],[177.1964995578142,71.59580834789465],[177.55674837143596,71.72281892374346],[177.56250209688963,71.72444595749224],[178.05150014514976,71.83386356419997],[178.0609194815812,71.8356125360297],[178.6789279037983,71.93170408724129],[178.6890924147711,71.93299981227808],[179.32582691090573,71.99790716180726],[179.33650190548798,71.99873567418251],[179.99754443307236,72.03454653065947],[180,72.03462348850644],[180,71.53585415493103],[179.8941363351774,71.52442715043135],[179.86022733514574,71.5166631504241],[179.85800033514388,71.50387315041216],[179.86400033514954,71.49164515040086],[179.7644363350567,71.46554515037657],[179.72051833501573,71.45610015036772],[179.5641453348701,71.44609115035837],[179.53027233483874,71.43830915035107],[179.22411833455337,71.31248215023398],[179.21078133454097,71.30775415022954],[178.95859133430605,71.24413615017028],[178.87219133422576,71.21748215014546],[178.63107233400117,71.06915415000728],[178.61940033399014,71.05317314999246],[178.61940033399028,71.03150914997221],[178.64776333401656,70.98915414993284],[178.70303633406817,70.93470914988207],[178.74883633411085,70.89220914984254],[178.78387233414364,70.83442714978871],[178.78360033414333,70.8055451497618],[178.79101833415004,70.79640014975334],[179.09551833443362,70.86748214981944],[179.27276333459875,70.88860014983915],[179.5183093348276,70.87691814982836],[179.6783183349765,70.89553614984563],[179.78137233507263,70.93678214988405],[179.79192733508228,70.9530451498992],[179.97717233525483,70.99552714993877],[180,70.99720913632007],[180,70.1489625744714]]],[[[-180,71.53584515044201],[-180,71.53584515044201]]],[[[-180,72.03462348850647],[-178.81095372393685,72.03344683656843],[-178.7969659583296,72.033061442877],[-177.5825979032926,71.96676353644925],[-177.56905915287447,71.96564620135963],[-176.45076815783057,71.84171689368046],[-176.43805576759843,71.83992542450356],[-175.29821002361106,71.64558395000593],[-175.29386021664877,71.64449978795297],[-175.11766504630103,71.59127432009394],[-175.11402942395236,71.58994654024154],[-174.96648404219349,71.52396179173374],[-172.54545759024072,70.85904478383462],[-172.07579823482388,70.77249846576288],[-172.0697081245068,70.77105880055339],[-171.66425763138687,70.65014467820271],[-171.65928368321545,70.64828583841921],[-170.93822531421836,70.34654614765137],[-170.9238409242542,70.34010604096132],[-170.23770369446603,70.01095318624601],[-170.22464078102325,70.0042318107258],[-169.60423575474525,69.6616929326219],[-169.59247916819436,69.65471729673311],[-169.02499208205856,69.29197501375394],[-169.02322739586756,68.08973333285319],[-169.05714956645394,67.9092824953323],[-169.05755864120223,67.90493587363964],[-169.05738623973858,67.71791536610051],[-169.09702458855782,67.68158479696055],[-169.2250877303035,67.61639607105283],[-169.33624993326845,67.57840844736299],[-169.48030275446314,67.54662098805296],[-169.70253601684192,67.50953874734194],[-169.8741301398054,67.49865287516188],[-170.02374057815143,67.49100637945364],[-170.21926670414467,67.530250261178],[-170.50096527270895,67.73921072393486],[-170.50686561127796,67.74312874222763],[-170.83837064286294,67.94105638247544],[-170.84521522262727,67.94474525387433],[-171.21717306268195,68.12646118324997],[-171.2249079845473,68.1298931370396],[-171.64968706712065,68.30087001810458],[-171.65828030558038,68.30400889798804],[-172.1925283986577,68.46940116142743],[-172.19879300922545,68.47090525090603],[-172.85085133904147,68.58830483540073],[-172.85848672596507,68.58986940150395],[-173.3428378330892,68.70616740586681],[-173.34985489853736,68.70812140576709],[-173.66744630150836,68.806072526732],[-173.67078717181056,68.80721023783147

These polynyas are used by birds, in particular, Steller’s eider, during the spring migration period (Solovieva, 1999; Gavrilo et al., 2011). The Laptev polynya network also sustains stable, high populations of seals, which in turn draw its main predator: the polar bear (Gavrilo et al., 2011).","ru":"The system of polynyas in the Laptev Sea and specific conditions of the waters of New Siberian Islands form an ecologically and biologically significant area with a high degree of naturalness, with limited shipping as the only human activity. Its most remarkable feature is the Laptev walrus. It was previously considered an endemic subspecies (Odobenus rosmarus laptevi), but the latest molecular \ngenetic studies have failed to prove its isolation from the Pacific subspecies (O. rosmarus divergens) (Lindquist et al., 2008).
